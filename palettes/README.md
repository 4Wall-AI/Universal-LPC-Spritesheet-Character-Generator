LPC Sprite Character Palettes
=============================================

I just collected all the palette variants I found where there's some consistency among the variations. Among the palettes that exist here are:

1. Hair Colors
2. Skintones
3. Metals (maybe it should be "Materials" instead and also include wood?)
4. Cloth

Eye Colors can probably also be added in here, too.

With multi-colored assets, I think its more ideal to have a separate layer to be able to freely mix and match colors. This isn't necessary but it adds more flexibility.


The .json files are designed to be used with lpctools:

If you start from a different source than the usual "base" color (I identify this as the palette used in the source directory of a certain color scheme), then the "source" in the .json file should be changed to the correct starting palette.

I don't know if there's any set standards for LPC palettes, this is just collecting all the common palettes that currently exist on the ULPC assets to make it easier to create palette variations.
