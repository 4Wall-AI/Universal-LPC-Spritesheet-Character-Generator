LPC Sprite CUSTOM Character Palettes
=============================================

Custom Palettes are for specific assets that may have one or more unique colors. This is only for assets which existed prior to making standardized palettes so we keep the original palette even with the recolors. I'll provide a list of asset palettes here to address which ones belong to where.


#### 1. ulpc-horn-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/head/horns
- Combines cloth, metal, and body palettes, along with a custom "horns" palette
- Possibility: I considered adding a "wood" palette from one of the bows. I opted against this for now but I think it'd be a cool idea.

#### 2. ulpc-mask-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/facial/masks/plain
- Combines cloth and metal palettes, along with custom "dark" and "light" palettes (possibly we could just stick with black/white from the cloth palettes but I wanted to keep the originals for legacy purposes)
- Possibility: I considered adding a "wood" palette from one of the bows. I opted against this for now but I think it'd be a cool idea.
