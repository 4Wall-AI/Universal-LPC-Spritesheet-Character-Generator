LPC Sprite CUSTOM Character Palettes
=============================================

Custom Palettes are for specific assets that may have one or more unique colors. This is only for assets which existed prior to making standardized palettes so we keep the original palette even with the recolors. I'll provide a list of asset palettes here to address which ones belong to where.


#### 1. ulpc-horn-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/head/horns
- Combines cloth, metal, and body palettes, along with a custom "horns" palette
- Possibility: I considered adding a "wood" palette from one of the bows. I opted against this for now but I think it'd be a cool idea.

#### 2. ulpc-mask-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/facial/masks/plain
- Combines cloth and metal palettes, along with custom "dark" and "light" palettes (possibly we could just stick with black/white from the cloth palettes but I wanted to keep the originals for legacy purposes)
- Possibility: I considered adding a "wood" palette from one of the bows. I opted against this for now but I think it'd be a cool idea.

#### 3. ulpc-glasses-monocle-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/facial/glasses/round
- Path: spritesheets/facial/glasses/sunglasses
- Path: spritesheets/facial/monocle/left/frame
- Path: spritesheets/facial/monocle/right/frame
- Combines cloth and metal palettes, along with custom "base" and "sunglasses" that are used in the round glasses, sunglasses (which are just a dark version of round glasses), as well as the frame for the monocle (which is based on the round glasses, or perhaps the monocle came first, not sure which). I opted to combine the brown and sunglasses palettes into one, though its possible we might not need either as the colors are similar to other colors. Still, I kept the original colors for legacy purposes.

#### 4. ulpc-eyepatch-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/facial/patches/eyepath
- Just a variation of the "cloth" palettes but including the original base palette from the original eyepatch sprites.

#### 5. ulpc-eyepatch-small-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/facial/patches/small
- Just a variation of the "cloth" palettes but including the original base palette from the original "patch" sprite, which I renamed into "small eyepatch".

#### 7. lpc-revised-to-ulpc-cloth-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/facial/earrings
- Combines cloth and metal palettes while also keeping the original gold-ish color palette from the original earring sprites.

#### 8. lpc-revised-to-ulpc-cloth-palettes.json
- Converts the default white color from LPC Revised to ULPC cloth palettes.
